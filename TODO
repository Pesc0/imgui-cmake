I would suggest you configure SDL2 with --disable-video-rpi --enable-video-kmsdrm as options. 
Unless you do, SDL2 gets configured with the old rpi driver in /opt/vc. 
And with --enable-video-kmsdrm you can use SDL2 in console, without X11. 
kmsdrm needs a couple of packages installed: libgdm-dev and libdrm-dev.
